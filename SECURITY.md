## Security Testing and Fuzz Testing

### Overview

The Argus Redis Provider undergoes comprehensive security testing including static analysis, dynamic testing, and **fuzz testing** to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure robust security in production environments.

### Fuzz Testing Implementation

This provider includes comprehensive fuzz testing implemented with Go's native fuzzing framework (Go 1.18+) to test critical security boundaries specific to Redis operations:

#### Fuzz Test Functions

1. **`FuzzValidateAndNormalizeRedisURL`** - Tests Redis URL validation security
   - **Attack Surface**: URL parsing and normalization for Redis connections
   - **Security Coverage**: SSRF prevention, Redis protocol injection, authentication bypass detection
   - **Seed Corpus**: Redis-specific URL formats, cluster configurations, sentinel setups, malicious URLs

2. **`FuzzValidateSecureRedisKey`** - Tests Redis key injection prevention
   - **Attack Surface**: Redis key validation and sanitization  
   - **Security Coverage**: Redis command injection (FLUSHDB, EVAL, CONFIG), dangerous pattern detection
   - **Seed Corpus**: Redis commands, injection attempts, encoded payloads, binary data

3. **`FuzzExtractRedisKey`** - Tests key extraction from URLs
   - **Attack Surface**: URL path processing for Redis key extraction
   - **Security Coverage**: Path traversal prevention, URL encoding bypass, key namespace protection
   - **Seed Corpus**: Malformed URLs, traversal attempts, encoded keys

4. **`FuzzRedisJSONParsing`** - Tests JSON parser resilience  
   - **Attack Surface**: JSON parsing from Redis server responses
   - **Security Coverage**: Memory exhaustion prevention, Redis-specific data type handling, oversized value protection
   - **Seed Corpus**: Large Redis values (up to 50MB), deeply nested structures, Redis command injection via JSON

5. **`FuzzRedisProviderLoad`** - Tests end-to-end provider functionality
   - **Attack Surface**: Complete Redis configuration loading process
   - **Security Coverage**: Integrated security validation, error handling safety, resource management
   - **Seed Corpus**: Malicious URLs, invalid configurations, Redis-specific edge cases

### Redis-Specific Security Considerations

#### Redis Command Injection Prevention
Redis supports powerful commands that can compromise system security:

**Critical Commands Blocked**:
- `FLUSHDB` / `FLUSHALL` - Database/server data deletion
- `CONFIG` - Server configuration manipulation  
- `EVAL` / `EVALSHA` / `SCRIPT` - Lua script execution
- `SHUTDOWN` - Server termination
- `DEBUG` - Debug commands with system access
- `MIGRATE` / `DUMP` / `RESTORE` - Data migration commands
- `SYNC` / `PSYNC` / `MONITOR` - Replication and monitoring
- `CLIENT` / `SENTINEL` - Client and sentinel management

#### Binary Data Handling
Redis keys and values can contain binary data, requiring special security handling:
- **Null Byte Injection**: Prevention of `\x00` in keys
- **Control Characters**: Filtering dangerous control characters
- **Protocol Confusion**: Preventing RESP protocol injection
- **Large Value Handling**: Safe processing of Redis's 512MB value limit

### Running Fuzz Tests

#### Quick Fuzz Testing (30 seconds each test)
```bash
make fuzz
```

#### Extended Fuzz Testing (5 minutes each test - recommended for CI)
```bash
make fuzz-extended  
```

#### Continuous Fuzz Testing (until interrupted)
```bash
make fuzz-continuous
```

#### Security-Focused CI Pipeline
```bash
make ci-security  # Includes static analysis + fuzz testing
```

### Interpreting Fuzz Test Results

#### Successful Fuzz Run
```
fuzz: elapsed: 30s, gathering baseline coverage: 0s, corpus: 234 (now: 234), crashers: 0
```
- **No crashers**: All inputs handled safely
- **Higher corpus**: Redis handles more input variety than other protocols
- **Baseline coverage**: Code paths exercised including Redis-specific logic

#### Fuzz Failure Indicators
```
fuzz: elapsed: 8s, gathering baseline coverage: 0s, corpus: 45 (now: 45), crashers: 1
```
- **crashers > 0**: Security vulnerability or crash found
- **Check testdata/fuzz/**: Contains failing inputs
- **Review crash logs**: Identify root cause (often Redis command injection)

#### Redis-Specific Security Violations
Look for these patterns in fuzz output:
- `SECURITY VIOLATION: Redis command` - Command injection detected
- `SECURITY VIOLATION: Dangerous pattern` - Suspicious Redis key patterns
- `SECURITY LEAK: Redis command in error` - Command exposure in error messages
- `RESOURCE VIOLATION: Response too large` - DoS via oversized Redis values

### Fuzz Test Security Coverage  

#### URL Validation Security (validateAndNormalizeRedisURL)
- **Redis Scheme Validation**: Enforces redis://, rediss://, unix:// schemes
- **Cluster/Sentinel Support**: Validates multi-node configurations safely
- **SSRF Prevention**: Blocks connections to internal services and metadata endpoints
- **Authentication Security**: Protects Redis AUTH credentials from exposure
- **Protocol Injection**: Prevents Redis protocol (RESP) manipulation

#### Redis Key Security (validateSecureRedisKey)
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Blocks all dangerous Redis commands
- **Binary Data Safety**: Handles binary keys without protocol confusion  
- **Pattern Validation**: Detects Redis-specific dangerous patterns (*, ?, [], {})
- **Length Limits**: Enforces Redis key size limits (512KB max)
- **Namespace Protection**: Prevents key namespace escape attempts

#### Key Extraction Security (extractRedisKey)
- **URL Path Validation**: Safely extracts keys from Redis URL paths
- **Encoding Safety**: Handles URL encoding without bypass vulnerabilities
- **Multi-segment Keys**: Properly processes complex Redis key structures
- **Protocol Separation**: Maintains distinction between URL and Redis protocol

#### JSON Parser Security (Redis JSON parsing)
- **Large Value Handling**: Safely processes Redis's large value capability (512MB)
- **Redis Data Types**: Properly handles Redis-specific data type representations
- **Command Injection in JSON**: Detects Redis commands embedded in configuration values
- **Memory Management**: Prevents memory exhaustion with oversized Redis responses

### Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Redis-Specific Testing**: Focus on Redis protocol and command injection
2. **Large Data Testing**: Use `fuzz-extended` for Redis's large value handling
3. **Multi-Instance Testing**: Test Redis Cluster and Sentinel configurations
4. **Binary Data Testing**: Include binary data in fuzz corpus
5. **Protocol Testing**: Validate RESP protocol handling safety

### Integration with Red Team Testing

Redis-specific security testing includes:
- **Static Analysis**: gosec, staticcheck for Redis client vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: govulncheck for known CVEs in Redis dependencies
- **Dynamic Testing**: Fuzz testing for Redis protocol and command safety
- **Red Team Testing**: Manual Redis security assessment and penetration testing
- **Protocol Testing**: RESP protocol manipulation and injection testing
- **Configuration Security**: Redis configuration parameter validation

### Redis Security Threat Model

#### Primary Attack Vectors
1. **Command Injection**: Malicious Redis commands in keys/values
2. **Protocol Injection**: RESP protocol manipulation
3. **Authentication Bypass**: Redis AUTH credential manipulation  
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to Redis data
5. **DoS Attacks**: Resource exhaustion via large values or complex operations
6. **SSRF Attacks**: Using Redis as pivot for internal network access

#### Mitigations Implemented
1. **Comprehensive Key Validation**: Blocks all dangerous Redis commands
2. **URL Validation**: Prevents SSRF and protocol injection
3. **Resource Limits**: Enforces safe memory and processing limits
4. **Error Safety**: Prevents credential and command leakage in errors
5. **Protocol Separation**: Maintains clean separation between HTTP and Redis protocols

### Continuous Security Improvement

The Redis provider fuzz testing suite is continuously enhanced based on:
- **Redis Security Research**: Latest Redis vulnerability research and CVEs
- **Protocol Security**: RESP protocol security analysis and improvements  
- **Command Security**: Analysis of new Redis commands and their security implications
- **Community Research**: External security research specific to Redis
- **Real-World Attacks**: Analysis of actual Redis security incidents
