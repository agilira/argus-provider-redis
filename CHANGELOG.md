## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Initial release of Argus Redis Provider
- Core provider implementation with full Redis integration
- Support for standalone Redis servers, Redis Cluster, and Redis Sentinel
- Unix socket connections for high-performance local deployments
- Comprehensive security testing suite with 60+ attack scenarios
- Thread-safe provider initialization with atomic operations
- Advanced injection prevention with Redis command filtering
- Resource limits for watch operations and concurrent connections
- Real-time configuration watching with Redis pub/sub
- TLS/SSL support with certificate validation

### Security
- Redis command injection prevention in key validation
- SSRF protection with localhost and internal service filtering  
- Path traversal attack protection with pattern matching
- Resource exhaustion protection with connection limits
- Response size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Input sanitization for all user-provided data
- Secure URL validation and normalization
- Protection against dangerous Redis commands (FLUSHDB, EVAL, etc.)

### Performance
- Pre-compiled security patterns for zero-allocation validation
- Efficient connection pooling with configurable limits
- Atomic counters for real-time metrics collection
- Optimized pub/sub mechanism for live configuration watching
- Connection reuse and keep-alive optimization
- Minimal memory allocations in hot paths

### Testing
- 100+ test cases covering core functionality and edge cases
- Security test suite with red team attack simulations
- Race condition detection with Go race detector
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations
- Integration tests with real Redis instances in CI/CD
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Example validation with automated compilation checks

### Code Quality
- Static analysis compliance (staticcheck, errcheck, gosec)
- Comprehensive race detector validation
- Code formatting with gofmt
- Cyclomatic complexity management
- Robust error handling for all operations
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflows with Redis service integration
- Multi-platform build matrix testing
- Automated security scanning with gosec
- Real Redis integration testing (not mocked)
- Dependabot support for dependency updates
- Quick PR validation for fast feedback

### Compatibility
- Redis 9.0+ support with backward compatibility
- Go 1.25+ requirement
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
